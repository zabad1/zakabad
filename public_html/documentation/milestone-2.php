			<p>I want the website to have lines of sentences that says things about my self. Links to my github, twitter,
			Linkin accounts. A picture of my self, with a gradinent blue background. A contact me on the front page and a
			second page with links of websites I've done and another contact me message. An easter egg on my picture. I
			want to have a quote from 'x' person, but I want it to be programed to be randomized so I can have many different
			quotes. So when you go to the website every time there is a new quote there.</p>
