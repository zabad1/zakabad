			<h3>Purpose</h3>

				<p>This site is aimed at web development companies and also be able to show non-web IT companies.</p>
			<h3>Goal</h3>
				<p>A site that shows what I look like as a person and what I have done in my work history and web developed projects. So companies can see what I have done and can get my contact info off my website.</p>
			<h2>Persona</h2>
				<p>Name: Jerry Chavez</p>
				<p>Age: 31</p>
				<p>Occupation: Freelance Artist </p>
				<p>Technology: android, HP pavilion</p>
				<p>Attitudes and Behaviors: Jerry is a graffiti style artist. He works for UPS as a side job to get his benefits and for a little extra cash. He watches his daughter when he gets home from work at early in morning around 7:30am to 8:00, because his UPS work time starts at 4:45am. When he gets home, his wife goes to work and the rest of the day he has family/dad duties to do for his wife and daughter. Jerry knows how to use basic technology at a basic level, has no desire to go further with it. But is seeking someone that can make him a website to show off his art.</p>
				<p>Frustrations and Needs: Jerry is needing a person that can build him a website, but is very poor and can't afford the average price range that it takes to hire someone to build a website to show off his art.
