			<h1>Zak Abad</h1>
			<p>Age:32</p>
			<p>Occupation: UPS supervisor</p>
			<p>Technology Education: Android, iPhone, iMac, PC</p>
			<p>Purpose</p>
			<p>Businesses that I apply to will see a site that is about me and whatever info they need to contact me. Any
			any demographic can look at my site, but it will be only for business use purposes.It will only need wireframing for </p>
			<p>Goals: A site that says a little bit about my personal self and also has info for my work history that I have
			done in the past and what I am doing currently for web developing. </p>
			<p>Frustrations/Additional information: The only frustrations I will have just remembering all the coding for building the site. Additional thing I want to do for my site is, have a quote from someone that you see above my profile picture, but I want the quote to change if you refresh the site or go back another time. So the end user will always see different quote every time they go to my website.</p>
