					<!--About me-->
					<h2 class="margin">Who Am I?</h2>
					<div class="colorBlock1"><p class="textBlock1">Hello and thank you for coming to my site! I've been in Albuquerque for most of my life, but have traveled some of the world and wish to see more of it. I do consider ABQ my home and where my heart lives. I met my wife here and had our daughter in ABQ.
							<br><br>When growing up with film, comics, and video games, I found that the template is the same for all three of these mediums and that's what attracts me to them as an art. But first and foremost I consider my self a film connoisseur but a student that is still mastering the craft of cinema. I do find my self very open minded and exploring the world of art. I always found enjoyment with working on computers and creating projects. So I always had the curiosity of making web sites.
							<br><br>I enjoy frontend design web development the most. But I am expanding to learn backend web development as well. It's hard for me as a person to just know apart of something and not knowing all aspects of the medium.</p></div>

					<h2 class="margin">Experience</h2>
					<div class="colorBlock2"><p class="textBlock2">I learned web development through a boot camp I took in ABQ is called, <a href="https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/" style="color: #484848" target="_blank">Deep Dive Coding</a> and here is the link to apply for the camp, <a href="https://stemuluscenter.org/" style="color: #484848" target="_blank">The STEMulus Center</a>. This is where I learned full stacked web development as a developer. I learned HTML5, Javascript, Angular2, mySQL, PHP, CSS3, Bootstrap, Git, and Jquery. Through this boot camp, I made a capstone that encompassed all material taught in class. Also built a full static website that you see here with HTML5 and CSS3.
							<br><br>I'm also proficient video editor. I mainly use Final Cut Pro X, Logic Pro X, Motion 5, and  Compressor 4. I learned using all these programs in college and through film projects of my own. I'm also a proficient photoshop editor. I learned this through being an editor for my friend's journal comic.</p></div>

					<h2 class="margin">Life</h2>
					<div class="colorBlock3"><p class="textBlock3">As said before, I've been ABQ, NM for most of my life. I met my wife here and had our first daughter last year. For the last ten years of my life I've been working for UPS as a supervisor. My life long desire is to work for my self. I want to get into film making as a full time career, but ultimately just would love to be able to work being in a creative art environment involving film, video games, or comics.
							<br><br> I don't remember when in my life that I considered watching a movies as a favorite hobby of mine. I've loved all from generations of film and television. I grew up watching Nick-at-Night. I wasn't ever picky by what I watched. I learned to love all film and tv that I watched and I even loved watching commercials. As a kid my mom would take me to the local video store or grocery store and rent movies on Tuesdays or Wednesday. These were the cheap days to rent movies or video games. This was one way my mom can entertain the family on a low budget. I have many fond memories of this. I can remember always asking to rent the same movie "Willow" as a kid, because of how much enjoyment I had watching it. I can remember many moments of watching movies at movie theaters, with classics like TMNT, Terminator 2, Disney classics, and many others. I also would spend summers trying to make money in the neighborhood, so I can walk to the movie theater to watch movies at the discount house. There me and my friends would play Mortal Kombat 2 and watch the same movie day after day, because there were only four screens to play movies on.
							<br><br>Since I always found the fascination of watching movies, I would mess around with the video camera and make home made movies. This has followed me into adulthood now and continue with it as an art. When I was old enough to have a job, I got a job at a movie theater. This is how much I loved movies. I didn't care about the pay, just wanted to be around film in my life.
							<br><br>In my college days, I've advance my skill more and learned more about the history of film. My favorite film makers are Robert Rodriguez, Stanley Kubrick, Jean Luc-Godard, Hal Ashby, and Walter Hill. Like I said before, I consider my self a student of film and am still mastering the craft of cinema.</p></div>
