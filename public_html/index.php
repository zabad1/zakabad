					<!--About me-->
					<h2 class="margin">Who Am I?</h2>
					<div class="colorBlock1"><p class="textBlock1">Hello and thank you for coming to my site! I've been in Albuquerque for most of my life, but have traveled some of the world and wish to see more of it. I do consider ABQ my home and where my heart lives. I met my wife here and had our daughter in ABQ.</p>
						<p class="textBlock1">When growing up with film, comics, and video games, I found that the template is the same for all three of these mediums and that's what attracts me to them as an art. But first and foremost I consider my self a film connoisseur but a student that is still mastering the craft of cinema. I do find my self very open minded and exploring the world of art. I always found enjoyment with working on computers and creating projects. So I always had the curiosity of making web sites.</p>

						<p class="textBlock1">I enjoy frontend design web development the most. But I am expanding to learn backend web development as well. It's hard for me as a person to just know apart of something and not knowing all aspects of the medium.</p></div>

					<div class="colorBlock3"><p class="textBlock3">Uh... okay, well, the button on the side, is it glowing? Dear Sir stroke Madam, I am writing to inform you of a fire which has broken out at the premises of... Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again? So, remember the new number! 0118 999! 88199, 9119 725! ... 3! Oh my God. I didn't even know Smarties made a cereal. They don't. It's just Smarties in a bowl with milk. Today I have a business empire the like of which the world has never seen the like of which. I hope it doesn't sound arrogant when I say that I am the greatest man in the world!

							How can you two... Don't Google the question, Moss! Yeah, you do know how a button works don't you? No, not on clothes. Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again? It's like they're pally-wally with us when there's a problem with their printer, but once it's fixed... They just toss us away like yesterday's jam. It's like they're pally-wally with us when there's a problem with their printer, but once it's fixed...

							Well that's easy to remember. 0118 999 88199 9119 725! ... 3! Might want to play a bit hard to get. It's my term for my time of the month. Oh. What time of the month? The weekend? Huh, what you think I'm afraid of you? I'm not afraid of you. Yes! Yesterday's jam. That is what we are to them!... Actually, that doesn't work, as a thing, because, you know, jam lasts for ages. If anyone was ever rude to me, I used to carry their food around in my trousers. Oh my God! Before you brought it to their table? No, after! Of course, before! Why would I do it after?

							Hello, IT. Have you tried forcing an unexpected reboot? You mean 999. Yes, yes, I mean 999! Yeah, I know. That's the American one, you berk! Nicer ambulances, faster response times and better looking drivers mean they're not just the Emergency Services, they're your Emergency Services. Might want to play a bit hard to get. 0115... no... 0118... no... 0118 999 ... 3. Hello? Is this the emergency services? Then which country am I speaking to? Hello? Hello? When I started Reynholm Industries, I had just two things in my possession: a dream and 6 million pounds.

							0115... no... 0118... no... 0118 999 ... 3. Hello? Is this the emergency services? Then which country am I speaking to? Hello? Hello? From today, dialing 999 won't get you the Emergency Services, and that's not the only thing that's changing! You can come down here any time and I'll be waiting for you! [slams down phone] That told her! Yeah, you need to turn it on... uh, the button turns it on. 0115... no... 0118... no... 0118 999 ... 3. Hello? Is this the emergency services? Then which country am I speaking to? Hello? Hello? So, remember the new number! 0118 999! 88199, 9119 725! ... 3!</p></div>
