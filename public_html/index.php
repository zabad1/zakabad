							And now, human music. boop beep boop... boop beep boop... Oh good job Morty! You killed my best customer but you saved a mind reading fart! No jumping in the sewer! Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit Ethan! They're inside you building a monument to compromise! Fuck them, fuck those people, fuck this whole thing Ethan.

							They're robots Morty! It's okay to shoot them! They're just robots! Well, she's my daughter, Summer. I outrank you. Or, family means nothing, in which case, don't play that card. Prepare to be emancipated from your own inferior genes! Principal Vagina here, don't let the name fool you; I'm very much in charge. Reminding you that tonight is our annual flu season dance. I don't know how many times I have to say this, but if you have the flu, stay home. The flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration. You don't bring dead babies to Passover.

					<div class="colorBlock3"><p class="textBlock3">Uh... okay, well, the button on the side, is it glowing? Dear Sir stroke Madam, I am writing to inform you of a fire which has broken out at the premises of... Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again? So, remember the new number! 0118 999! 88199, 9119 725! ... 3! Oh my God. I didn't even know Smarties made a cereal. They don't. It's just Smarties in a bowl with milk. Today I have a business empire the like of which the world has never seen the like of which. I hope it doesn't sound arrogant when I say that I am the greatest man in the world!

							How can you two... Don't Google the question, Moss! Yeah, you do know how a button works don't you? No, not on clothes. Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again? It's like they're pally-wally with us when there's a problem with their printer, but once it's fixed... They just toss us away like yesterday's jam. It's like they're pally-wally with us when there's a problem with their printer, but once it's fixed...

							Well that's easy to remember. 0118 999 88199 9119 725! ... 3! Might want to play a bit hard to get. It's my term for my time of the month. Oh. What time of the month? The weekend? Huh, what you think I'm afraid of you? I'm not afraid of you. Yes! Yesterday's jam. That is what we are to them!... Actually, that doesn't work, as a thing, because, you know, jam lasts for ages. If anyone was ever rude to me, I used to carry their food around in my trousers. Oh my God! Before you brought it to their table? No, after! Of course, before! Why would I do it after?

							Hello, IT. Have you tried forcing an unexpected reboot? You mean 999. Yes, yes, I mean 999! Yeah, I know. That's the American one, you berk! Nicer ambulances, faster response times and better looking drivers mean they're not just the Emergency Services, they're your Emergency Services. Might want to play a bit hard to get. 0115... no... 0118... no... 0118 999 ... 3. Hello? Is this the emergency services? Then which country am I speaking to? Hello? Hello? When I started Reynholm Industries, I had just two things in my possession: a dream and 6 million pounds.

							0115... no... 0118... no... 0118 999 ... 3. Hello? Is this the emergency services? Then which country am I speaking to? Hello? Hello? From today, dialing 999 won't get you the Emergency Services, and that's not the only thing that's changing! You can come down here any time and I'll be waiting for you! [slams down phone] That told her! Yeah, you need to turn it on... uh, the button turns it on. 0115... no... 0118... no... 0118 999 ... 3. Hello? Is this the emergency services? Then which country am I speaking to? Hello? Hello? So, remember the new number! 0118 999! 88199, 9119 725! ... 3!</p></div>
