# Milestone 1 feedback

Your directory structure is perfect, and your HTML is done very well. The only problem with HTML that I can see is that you're missing a couple of things in your head. Look at the documentation in the future and add the needed things (such as utf-8).

Your purpose, audience, and goal is correct, and fits the scope of what you'll learn in the class for your site. Some sections seems incomplete, or maybe just worded wrong. Not a big deal, but make sure to use correct grammar in the future, especially for the final site.

Also, your goal needs a little more detail. I understand that companies can see what you've worked on, but I'd also like to know what your FINAL goal is with this site. Are you trying to get hired as a developer? Are you just building a site to showcase your skills? Tell us about that.

Your Persona is a great example of a freelance client, but there is some things I'm still wondering about. 
  Technology: Android on what device? HP Pavillion using what version of windows? What browser does he use?
  
Use Case: Written very well. No issues there, although I do have more suggestions/information for you. First of all, your website will incorporate an email contact form. Also, specify why Jerry likes your site for what he wants done. Does he like the styling and format of the site? Does he like the things you showcase on it? Think about that as you proceed with development, because it will help you plan out a site that is appealing to the types of clients you want to do work for.

Otherwise, your Use Case does well in explaining everything you mentioned above. Great job with this.

## Overall, great job. Some little issues here and there but nothing major. Watch the grammar, and keep up the good work for the next milestone. You've passed in tier 3.
