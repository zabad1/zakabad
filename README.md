## Milestone 1 feedback

Your directory structure is perfect, and your HTML is done very well. The only problem with HTML that I can see is that you're missing a couple of things in your head. Look at the documentation in the future and add the needed things (such as utf-8).

Your purpose, audience, and goal is correct, and fits the scope of what you'll learn in the class for your site. Some sections seems incomplete, or maybe just worded wrong. Not a big deal, but make sure to use correct grammar in the future, especially for the final site.

Also, your goal needs a little more detail. I understand that companies can see what you've worked on, but I'd also like to know what your FINAL goal is with this site. Are you trying to get hired as a developer? Are you just building a site to showcase your skills? Tell us about that.

Your Persona is a great example of a freelance client, but there is some things I'm still wondering about. 
  Technology: Android on what device? HP Pavillion using what version of windows? What browser does he use?
  
Use Case: Written very well. No issues there, although I do have more suggestions/information for you. First of all, your website will incorporate an email contact form. Also, specify why Jerry likes your site for what he wants done. Does he like the styling and format of the site? Does he like the things you showcase on it? Think about that as you proceed with development, because it will help you plan out a site that is appealing to the types of clients you want to do work for.

Otherwise, your Use Case does well in explaining everything you mentioned above. Great job with this.

#### Overall, great job. Some little issues here and there but nothing major. Watch the grammar, and keep up the good work for the next milestone. You've passed in tier 3.

Your directory structure is perfect, but your HTML has one noticeable issue. Your meta charset tag needs to be within the head. Yours is above it. Make sure to fix this.

Otherwise, your HTML is good.

Considering I've seen the site you're basing this off of, I like your design. Make sure to think back to what I suggested. Make sure it's still visually appealing. 

What's your Easter Egg going to do? Have you thought about that yet?

Your mobile layout may not work. I would try to stretch the content across the full page so it's not too small. That would of course affect the way your background image looks. I like your desktop design, but I would try to rethink your mobile design completely. You could still have the same basic design, but maybe add a filter over the entire background so it's very dark, and your text is still easily readable over the top of it. 

I like your social media icons at the bottom. Make sure these fit with the design and don't look like they're just floating there. For the Social Media icons, have a look Font Awesome. Very easy to use, simple and straightforward. http://fontawesome.io/

Overall, you did a good job of replicating the site you showed me earlier. Try to make it a little more entertaining. Include some modals, or cool design changes so it's atleast a little different. 

#### You've passed Milestone 2a in Tier III. Good job.

## Milestone 3 / Final Feedback
Beautiful job on your PWP. Your layout looks great on both desktop and mobile - you've done a great job using the Bootstrap grid system to your advantage here. You've also done a nice job keeping your layout and design choices simple yet effective. This is a great example of how a simple color palette combined with a clean layout and a good typeface can have strong visual impact. Your form appears to function well on my end - so check your email to see if you have received my test message.

Congrats on a PWP well done. Your project passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Nice work!
